## Overview

The Abel NGO Core Ontologies (ontologies kernel) are defined of three
primary _domain ontologies_, a _bibliographical ontology_ and a set of
contextual _typing and categorization_ ontologies.

The domain ontologies:

* Events Domain Ontology
* Entity Domain Ontology
* Locale Domain Ontology

Each of the primary _domain ontologies_ in the Abel NGO ontologies
kernel is extended with one or more of an ontology for contextual
typing and categorization of known events, entities, and locales,
within the respective reference domain.

Additionally, an ontology is defined for structural bibliographical
references, as to be applied in development of any later _instance
ontologies_
